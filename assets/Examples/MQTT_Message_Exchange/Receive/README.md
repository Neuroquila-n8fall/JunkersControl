These are the example messages which can be processed by the application. These messages will, for example, trigger a message which is then received by your MQTT broker.

- [Heating Parameters](ExampleHeatingParameters.json) lets you configure the temperatures, behavior of your heating circuit and operation mode
- [Water Parameters](ExampleWaterParameters.json) lets you configure the temperature and behavior of your hot water circuit
- [Request Status](ExampleRequestStatus.json) lets you request values on demand rather than waiting for the ESP to send it.
